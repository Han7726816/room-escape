        Once upon a time, there was a kid. Inspired by multiple pianists in the world, he decided to become one himself in the future. 
        He then joins a piano competition at the age of 9. He won. He hanged the photo of him 
        winning on the wall. The other day, he was asked to let one of the competitors to visit his house to
        share experience. And while he was gone to the toilet, the competitor felt jealous and tore the 
        picture while his parents were talking and put the torn piece into a drawer. The kid only 
        realised it afterwards.

    <div class="popup note2 note">
        However, the boy did not let that incident get the better of him. He wrote multiple music sheets and slid it into the first page of every book in the
        bookshelf. He thought that every book now has its own opening, and arranged every book according to its colour and
        height, with green on the left and blue on the right in ascending order. Unfortunately, when his father came to find his car keys and somehow shuffled the books. <br> 
        He then thought of something: <br>
        What if the sheet of the last book of the series is a code to a secret pathway?
        What if playing the piano with certain melody triggers a secret doorpath? Thinking about it, he slowly fell asleep.

    <div class="popup note3 note">
        It was around midnight that he woke up and realised that his dad took him to bed because he saw
        him sleeping on the floor. He noticed that his alarm clock was 3pm which clearly did not match up. He then brought it to 
        the living room to try and fix it, but had a sudden inspiration and went to write sheet music 
        instead. He titled it "My favourite song". After finishing the whole rhythm, he accidentally tore the
        sheet music apart without realising it due to tiredness and took the other half to his bedroom and slept with it.
